# ScalaIRC
This is my IRC client, which is currently under development.
Currently it supports only connecting to freenode #botwar channel and reading/sending messages.

This project uses sbt, QtJambi library and ScalaTest framework.

## Nearest plans
* Do final steps for multiple servers and channels support
* Finish chat window
* Add support for basic commands (/join, /me, /msg, /nick etc)

## Running
```
sbt run
```

## Testing
```
sbt test
```
